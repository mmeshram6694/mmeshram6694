## 🔬 About Me

Throughout my journey, I’ve been passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful strategies that drive operational excellence and business growth. With an MBA in Business Analytics and over 8 years of experience in high-impact environments, I’ve led critical initiatives across supply chain optimization, logistics redesign, and process automation—delivering \$ 18 M+ in value through insight-driven decision-making.

Whether it’s streamlining end-to-end fuel logistics, reengineering vendor workflows using SAP S/4HANA, or building cross-functional KPI dashboards in Power BI and Tableau, I thrive in roles that demand strategic thinking backed by data. My analytical mindset and hands-on skills with tools like SQL, Python, R, and DAX allow me to uncover patterns, reduce inefficiencies, and enable proactive actions across the business.

Driven by continuous improvement and a passion for solving complex business problems, I bridge domain expertise with data fluency to align KPIs with strategy and deliver actionable insights. I help organizations move from reactive operations to data-driven decision-making that boosts efficiency and impact.
